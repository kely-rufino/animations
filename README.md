Make an HTML file and a CSS file. Build these elements with these animations:
1. Make a box change from one colour to another on repeat
2. Make a button that changes colour when you hover over it
<button>
3. Make a box that:
    1. Part 1: the box should move right/down/left/up in a square and then back again, on repeat
    2. Part 2: When you hover over it, it should stop
4. Make a box that doubles the height on click, and collapses when it's clicked again

Extra:
Make the animated box a circle when it's clicked.
